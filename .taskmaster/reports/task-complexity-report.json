		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Project Setup and Configuration task into 4 subtasks covering: 1) Next.js installation and initial configuration, 2) UI library setup with Tailwind and shadcn/ui, 3) State management setup with Zustand and React Query, and 4) Project structure organization and dark mode implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard project initialization but requires coordinating multiple modern technologies (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Zustand, React Query). While each individual step is well-documented, ensuring proper integration between all components requires moderate expertise. The dark mode implementation adds some complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Data Models and State Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Data Models and State Management task into 5 subtasks covering: 1) Core data model interfaces definition, 2) Zustand store setup with persistence, 3) List management actions implementation, 4) Category and item CRUD operations, and 5) Statistics calculation utilities.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires designing a robust data model with multiple related entities and implementing a complete state management solution with local storage persistence. The complexity comes from ensuring type safety across the application, implementing proper normalization for the data, and creating all necessary CRUD operations with proper error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "List Management UI Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the List Management UI Components task into 4 subtasks covering: 1) List creation form and modal implementation, 2) List card and overview components, 3) List detail view with statistics, and 4) List action handlers (edit, delete, duplicate, etc.).",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple interconnected UI components that need to work with the state management system. The components require form validation, responsive design considerations, and proper state updates. The complexity is moderate as the UI patterns are common, but ensuring proper data flow and user experience requires careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Item and Category Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Item and Category Management task into 5 subtasks covering: 1) Category components implementation, 2) Item components with priority and quantity controls, 3) Drag-and-drop reordering with dnd-kit, 4) Inline editing functionality, and 5) Mobile swipe gesture implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the drag-and-drop functionality, which requires careful implementation to ensure good performance and accessibility. The inline editing, mobile swipe gestures, and maintaining state consistency across multiple interactive components add significant complexity. This is a core feature of the application that affects the main user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Progress Tracking and Visualization",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Progress Tracking and Visualization task into 3 subtasks covering: 1) Progress calculation utilities implementation, 2) Visual progress indicators (bars, percentages, colors), and 3) Priority visualization and sorting options.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing calculation logic and visual indicators for tracking progress. The complexity is moderate as it requires integrating with the existing state management and creating reusable components for visualization. The calculations themselves are straightforward, but ensuring they update correctly in response to user actions adds some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Template Library Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Template Library Implementation task into 4 subtasks covering: 1) Default templates data creation, 2) Template browsing and preview UI, 3) Template application and customization functionality, and 4) Template categorization and management features.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires creating a library of pre-defined templates and implementing the UI for browsing, previewing, and applying them. The complexity comes from managing the template data structure, implementing preview functionality, and ensuring proper application of templates to create new lists. The template combination feature adds additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Search, Filter, and Duplicate Detection",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Search, Filter, and Duplicate Detection task into 4 subtasks covering: 1) Search component and functionality implementation, 2) Filter controls and filtering logic, 3) Duplicate detection algorithm with Levenshtein distance, and 4) Duplicate warning UI and interaction handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing search algorithms, filtering mechanisms, and duplicate detection with fuzzy matching. The Levenshtein distance algorithm for fuzzy matching adds significant complexity, as does creating an intuitive UI for handling potential duplicates. Ensuring good performance with large datasets requires careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Export and Sharing Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Export and Sharing Functionality task into 4 subtasks covering: 1) PDF export implementation with jsPDF, 2) Text export functionality, 3) Print-friendly view creation, and 4) Sharing features with URL generation and QR codes.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires integrating with external libraries for PDF generation and implementing custom export formats. The complexity comes from ensuring proper rendering of lists in different formats, handling various content sizes, and implementing secure sharing functionality. The QR code generation and clipboard integration add additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Mobile Responsiveness and Gestures",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Mobile Responsiveness and Gestures task into 5 subtasks covering: 1) Responsive layout implementation with Tailwind, 2) Touch gesture implementation with use-gesture, 3) Mobile-specific UI components, 4) Offline support with service workers, and 5) Performance optimization for mobile devices.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the implementation of touch gestures, offline support, and ensuring good performance across various mobile devices. The gesture system requires careful implementation to ensure good user experience, and offline support with sync adds significant complexity. Testing across multiple devices and browsers increases the difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Accessibility and Final Polish",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Accessibility and Final Polish task into 5 subtasks covering: 1) WCAG 2.1 AA compliance implementation, 2) Dark mode with theme persistence, 3) Animation and transition effects with Framer Motion, 4) Error handling and fallback UI, and 5) Performance optimization and final testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it requires ensuring the entire application meets accessibility standards, which affects all components. Implementing proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and focus management requires careful attention to detail. The animations, error handling, and performance optimizations add additional layers of complexity that affect the entire application."
