			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Enhanced Navigation System Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the navigation system implementation into granular subtasks: (1) Breadcrumb navigation, (2) Sidebar navigation, (3) Mobile-responsive menu, (4) Contextual navigation, (5) Navigation configuration, (6) Main layout integration, (7) App layout update, (8) Navigation state management and hooks. For each, specify UI, accessibility, state, and role-based logic requirements.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple interdependent UI components, state management, role-based filtering, and responsive design, each with distinct logic and accessibility requirements. The breadth of features and the need for robust testing and integration across device types and user roles make this a high-complexity task. Industry best practices recommend modularizing each navigation concern and ensuring accessibility and maintainability, which justifies a detailed subtask breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Admin Dashboard Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the admin dashboard foundation into subtasks: (1) Admin layout and navigation, (2) Dashboard overview page, (3) User management (listing, editing, roles), (4) Analytics dashboard (charts, metrics), (5) Content moderation tools, (6) System settings interface, (7) Role-based access control, (8) Middleware for route protection, (9) Integration with authentication, (10) Security and audit logging. For each, define UI, backend, and integration requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Building a comprehensive admin dashboard requires complex UI, data visualization, permissions, moderation workflows, and secure settings management. Each area (user management, analytics, moderation, settings, access control) is a significant feature with its own logic, data flows, and security considerations. Industry standards dictate clear separation of concerns, robust access control, and thorough integration testing, warranting a high complexity score and a detailed subtask structure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Navigation System Routing and Filtering Issues",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the routing and filtering fixes into: (1) Implement missing routes/pages, (2) Audit and correct route configuration, (3) Fix sidebar filter navigation and query handling, (4) Verify and correct role-based navigation logic, (5) Comprehensive testing with Kapture MCP and cross-role scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task is focused on bug fixing and remediation, but spans multiple root causes: missing routes, misconfigured navigation, broken filters, and role-based access issues. While not as architecturally complex as a new system, it requires systematic investigation, code changes across several modules, and thorough regression testing, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Missing Convex Item Management Operations",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the Convex item/category management into: (1) Implement updateItem mutation, (2) Implement deleteItem mutation, (3) Implement updateCategory mutation, (4) Implement deleteCategory mutation, (5) Implement toggleCategoryCollapse, (6) Implement reorderItems. For each, specify backend mutation, frontend integration, and test coverage.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing several backend mutations and integrating them with the frontend, each with its own logic and error handling. Ensuring atomicity, consistency, and UI feedback for each operation increases complexity. Best practices recommend treating each operation as a separate subtask for clarity and testability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Template System Backend Functions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down template backend implementation into: (1) applyTemplate mutation, (2) saveAsTemplate mutation, (3) duplicateList mutation, (4) Frontend integration and testing for all template operations.",
			"reasoning": "Template management involves several related backend operations and their integration with the frontend. While each mutation is conceptually straightforward, ensuring correct data flows, permissions, and UI feedback adds moderate complexity. Industry standards suggest separating each mutation and its integration for maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Navigation History Remove Function",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Implement removeFromRecent logic in navigation history store, (2) Integrate with UI and test removal functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This is a focused, low-complexity task involving a single function and its UI integration. The logic is simple, but should be tested for correct state updates and UI feedback."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Analytics Service for Performance Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Select and configure analytics service (e.g., Google Analytics), (2) Implement data sending logic in performance.ts, (3) Verify integration and test data flow.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating an external analytics service is a standard task with clear steps: configuration, implementation, and verification. Complexity is low to moderate, depending on the analytics provider and data privacy requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Error Reporting Service",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Select and configure error reporting service (e.g., Sentry), (2) Implement integration in error-utils.ts, (3) Test error capture and reporting in development and production.",
			"reasoning": "Error reporting integration is a common task, involving service setup, code integration, and verification. Complexity is moderate, with attention needed for environment-specific configuration and privacy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Implement TypeScript and ESLint Checking in Dev Tools",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Implement TypeScript type checking logic, (2) Implement ESLint checking logic and integrate with dev tools UI.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward task involving the implementation of two static analysis tools. Complexity is low, but care should be taken to ensure proper integration and developer feedback."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Dashboard Features",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement user management features, (2) Implement system settings features, (3) Integrate with backend APIs, (4) Test and validate all admin dashboard features.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves replacing placeholders with real features in the admin dashboard. Each feature (user management, settings) is a moderate-sized module requiring backend integration and UI work. Complexity is moderate due to the need for robust testing and integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Remove Debug Console Logs from Production Code",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Audit and remove or conditionally wrap debug logs in all code modules, (2) Verify no debug logs remain in production builds.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-complexity code cleanup task, involving codebase search and minor refactoring. It is important for production hygiene but does not involve complex logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Navigation Guard Authentication Check",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Implement proper role-based authentication logic in navigation guard, (2) Test navigation guard with different user roles and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves replacing a placeholder with real authentication logic and testing it. While the logic is not complex, it is critical for security and requires careful testing."
